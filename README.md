Here below the instructions how to execute the solution for the **Advent of Code Puzzle 2018/8 - Memory Maneuver** made for Sage + Archer.


### How to set up ###

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/zaFa87/sageArcherCodePuzzle.git
```

##### Virtual environment #####
It is always a good idea to create a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the environment
```

```
When you are done you can deactivate the environment
```
deactivate
```
You can skip the above steps if you are using a code editor like _PyCharm_

When you are sure your virtual environment is running you can proceed.

### How to run the program ###

```
python3 main.py
```

For running all the tests
